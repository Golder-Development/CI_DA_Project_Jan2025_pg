        "    Transform: Clean the data, handle missing values, and create new features such as sales differences between holiday and non-holiday weeks.\n",
        "    Load: Store the transformed data in a format suitable for analysis (e.g., a cleaned DataFrame).\n",
        "Data Visualisation:\n",
        "    Descriptive Statistics: Display basic statistics such as average sales per store and department.\n",
        "    Trend Analysis: Plot sales trends over time for different stores and departments.\n",
        "    Impact Analysis: Visualise the impact of markdowns on sales during holidays versus non-holiday periods.\n",
